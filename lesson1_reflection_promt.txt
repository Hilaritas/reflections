How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   It was written near by each other - so it was easier to view the diffs

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It saves time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    If you use Google docs it is nice, that you do not have to bother about saving. 
	But if you make mistakes or if you want to some kinde of version - control it is
	far more work to do. There is more control in the way git provides.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git works Porject - oriented and Google docs ist document - oriented. But if multiple
	documents depend on each other and there is a change throuout, then Git will be the better choice.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git log I can see the head - information of the different commits - their ID and, if added, some commments. 
	I got a feeling, that it will be important to add some messages to the commits. To look for differences I can use git diff 
	followed two IDs to compare. Then I can watch the changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It is much easiere to find mistakes - so it does not matter so much, if something brakes. It is easy to find the problem due to 
	git diff

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    While Programming or even while building websites it will be very helpful to work with git.
	It is easier to adjust changes or to try some new ideas. Now they are easy to handle.
