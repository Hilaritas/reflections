What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It prepares the directory for later version - controls. How else should git know, where to look at?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

In the staging area are all items which I want to commit. But I can choose, which of the items inside my directory should be tracked.
This way I keep the controle which parts of my directory will be watched by git.
